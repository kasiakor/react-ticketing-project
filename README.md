# Ticketing Project

## Introduction

It is a web-based application with which the user can access a list of the latest tickets.
The first screen of the application is a login page.
After successful login user is navigated to the main screen of the application.
The correctness of each Tax ID is checked, based on the correctness algorithm of the Greek Tax
ID.
The user, by double-clicking on the description of a ticket, can change the status of the ticket
to "Finished". The specific change is made by calling the serverâ€™s API.
The user, by pressing a button in the upper right corner of the screen, can change
the way the ticket list is displayed from tabs to grid format and vice versa.
The app is responsive.
